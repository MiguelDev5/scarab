## Deploy Your Own

> Note: one-click deployment is a bit broken at the moment – you'll need to change some of the hard-coded values in the codebase to get it working. We're working on fixing this.

You can deploy your own hosted version of Scarab for greater privacy & control. Just click the link below to deploy a ready-to-go version of Dub to Vercel.
